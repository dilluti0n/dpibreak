.SH NAME
dpibreak \- simple and efficient DPI circumvention tool in Rust.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpibreak
.RI [ OPTIONS ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DPIBreak
is a simple and efficient tool for circumventing Deep Packet
Inspection (DPI), especially on HTTPS connections. It fragments the
TCP packet carrying the TLS ClientHello so that certain DPI devices
cannot extract the Server Name Indication (SNI) field and identify the
destination site.

It only applies to the first outbound segment that carries the TLS
ClientHello; Other packets are not queued to userspace and pass
through the kernel normally, unmodified. UDP/QUIC (HTTP/3) is not
affected.

This program is cross\-platform and runs the same way on both Linux
and Windows. No manual firewall configuration is required: starting
the program enables it system\-wide; stopping it disables it.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
.TP
\fBLinux\fR
Root privileges (or capabilities
.BR CAP_NET_ADMIN
and
.BR CAP_NET_RAW )
are required to install rules and attach to NFQUEUE. The
.B nft
command should be available. If it is not,
.B dpibreak
try to fallback
.B iptables
and
.B ip6tables.
Kernel support for
.BR nfnetlink_queue
and
.BR xt_u32
(when
.B nft
is not available)
is required. (these modules are typically auto\-loaded)

.TP
\fBWindows\fR
Administrator privilege is required to open the
WinDivert driver; the program opens the driver automatically at
startup.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-delay\-ms \fIu64\fR
Delay in milliseconds to apply between fragmented pieces of the
ClientHello. Typical values are 0â€“1000; larger values may increase
handshake latency. (default: 0)
.TP
.B \-\-queue\-num \fIu16\fR
.Linux only.
NFQUEUE number to attach to. The same queue number is
used for IPv4 and IPv6. (default: 1)
.TP
.B \-\-loglevel \fIdebug|info|warning|error\fR
Set the logging level (default:
.BR warning ).
Aliases:
.BR warn " \-> " warning ,
.BR err " \-> " error .
.TP
.B \-\-no\-splash
Disable splash messages at startup.
.TP
.B \-h , \-\-help
Show usage information and exit.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Run with default options:
.PP
.RS
.B dpibreak
.RE
.PP
Run with a 10 ms delay and verbose logging:
.PP
.RS
.B dpibreak \-\-delay\-ms 10 \-\-loglevel debug
.RE
.PP
Use a custom NFQUEUE on Linux:
.PP
.RS
.B dpibreak \-\-queue\-num 3
.RE

.SH BUGS
Although the program works reliably in the author's region and ISP,
different regions, ISPs, or organizations may deploy different DPI
equipment. In such cases, there is a chance that
.B dpibreak
does not function as expected. If you encounter such issue, please
report symptoms and, if possible, packet capture logs (e.g., collected
with Wireshark) or hints such as cases where alternative tools like
GoodByeDPI succeed with specific settings to the bug tracker listed
below.
.PP
When sharing packet capture logs, please make sure they do not contain
sensitive personal information (e.g., passwords or session cookies).
It is usually enough to capture only the initial handshake packets
showing the issue, rather than full sessions.
.PP
Any other problems not covered above are also appreciated.

Report bugs at <https://github.com/dilluti0n/dpibreak/issues>.

.SH SECURITY AND PRIVACY
The program does not store or transmit your traffic. Fragmentation is
performed locally on the host; no external proxy or relay is used.

.SH EXIT STATUS
Normally, \fBdpibreak\fR runs continuously until interrupted by the
user (e.g. with Ctrl+c) or the system. In such cases it exits with
status 0. Non\-zero exit codes are returned if the program fails to
start (for example, due to insufficient privileges, missing
iptables/WinDivert, or invalid options).
